Dynamically persistence and enhancement in memory with datanucleus
This project is a demonstrator for the usage of persistence with datanucleus.
This is also a test-bench for the persistence that is used in chappy.
This is a controlled environment to be used by the persistence mechanism.

This is using dynamically enhancement of the annotated classes.
Dynamically enhancement is done in memory, and the classloaders are used to make queries.  

Problems that are not solved yet:
- Classloaders for generated bytecode by enhancement.
- Query with classloader does not work until restart and reload of the enhanced classes.
