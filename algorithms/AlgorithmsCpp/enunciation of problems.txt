		Problems for Algorithms and C++
1)Implement a class which make the summ of two numbers. You must use special functions for adding, printing and inputs. From this calss yu  must derivate other class which make the product.
2)Implement a class implement dinamic queue, each element of the queue will be a derivated class from another class which has one private integer.
3)Implement a program who read from keyboard a dinamic alocation vector of numbers, and after that it determine the numbers of realization of each number. The number of realization will be stored into a dinamic simple link list, dinamic alocated.
4)Implement a program who read from keyboard a dinamic alocation vector of numbers, and after that it determine the numbers of realization of each number. The number of realization will be stored into a dinamic simple link list, dinamic alocated. The list will be upward ordered.
5)Implement a program who read from keyboard a dinamic alocation vector of numbers, and after that it determine the numbers of realization of each number. The number of realization will be stored into a dinamic simple link list, dinamic alocated. The list will be downward ordered.
6)Write a function who reate a list simple linked in which, every node, near the adress information, will has student date: numele char[20];prenumele:char[20];a real vector which hold the realization of the student, and a real number which hold the average of the student.
a)write a fucntion which return the overall average of the students from the list.
b)write a function who sort downward the elements of the list after the average of the student.
c)write a function who list the students which have the average over a specific average.
d)write a function who list the student alowed to a contest which has only k places.
7)Implement a program in C++ with clases who find if a graph is a tree.
